Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an AI paradigm focused on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data, RL agents learn through interaction with their environment, receiving feedback via rewards or penalties. This feedback guides the agent's actions, aiming to optimize a policy that maps states to actions for maximum long-term reward.
In RL, the agent-environment interaction is central. The agent takes actions based on its current state, and the environment responds by providing new states and rewards. Key algorithms in RL include Q-learning, which involves learning a Q-value function that estimates the expected utility of actions, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which use neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
RL has seen remarkable achievements, such as mastering games like Go and Dota 2, showcasing its potential for complex decision-making tasks. Applications extend to robotics, autonomous driving, and resource management. However, RL faces challenges like sample inefficiency, high computational demands, and difficulty in defining suitable reward structures. Despite these challenges, ongoing research continues to enhance RL's capabilities and applications.
